# Conference Talks by Kenneth Reitz

This repo contains all the presentations from [all of my conference talks](https://www.kennethreitz.org/talks) (and the fonts required) since 2011, when I got started. 

All are available in their respective presentation formats, as well as PDF. Included are the typefaces used.

All slides are Licensed Apache 2.0. Fonts distribute are not re-licensed, but are providing for simplicity.

# TODO

- Add links (in `README.md`) of recordings of talks.
